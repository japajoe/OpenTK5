# OpenTK5
A framework for rendering 3D graphics with OpenGL. This library combines OpenTK.Core/OpenTK.Graphics/OpenTK.Mathematics into a single binary. I do not actively maintain this repository so don't expect any bugfixes here.

# Installation
```
dotnet add package JAJ.Packages.OpenTK5 --version 1.0.0
```
